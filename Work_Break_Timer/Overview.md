# Pomodoro Break

This project is the creation of a pomodoro break.
A promodoro break is when you Set your timer for 25 minutes, and focus on a single task until the timer rings.
When your session ends, mark off one pomodoro and record what you completed. Then enjoy a five-minute break. 
After four pomodoros, take a longer, more restorative 15-30 minute break.
